# TFMandarinTTS

A demo version of merlin with mandarin fronted to make a simple tte system.

+ Merlin is too complicated for TTS noob like me, thus i want to write a simple but clear system merlin just for mandarin .

+ Theano is great but it's out of date now,i want to replace it with Tensorflow or Pytorch.

+ The code style of merlin is esay for normal user with cfg file to modify as their purpose change but not for developer .

## Thing will do

+ remove all shell scipt
+ extract necessary code for a demo tts system
+ Use python wrapper for all tools include HTS,WORLD,FESTIVAL,SPTK

## code from

This repo copy lots of code from [JackieXiao MTTS](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/MTTS) and [Merlin](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/merlin)
